### National Park Location vs. Population Density
The map I chose to make for this week is similar to one we looked at it a previous lecture. I was curious of the relationship between National Parks and population density. I wanted to know if states with lower population density were home to larger numbers of parks. I used the basemap I completed in a previous lecture but then gathered data from data world and made a spreadsheet and then converted to a geoJson file. I then used the font awesome application to symbolize these points on my map. I chose a tree to represent nature. I then added interaction to these points, therefore when you click on the trees they display the name of the park. Overall I believe this map showcased the locations of parks but did not have much of a correlation with population density, as California had many park locations with a population density above 200 per sq. mile.
